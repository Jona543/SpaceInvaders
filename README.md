# Space Invaders

### Description

I created this project as a way of furthering and practising my skills in Java. Made entinerly in Java, I used AWT and Swing packages to generate a window to host the game, with pictures found online as objects on screen. When the game runs, aliens will travel side to side on screen until they are all shot down by the ship, at which point they will regenerate with more numbers. The total score is kept and shown in the top corner of the window. 

This was my first attempt at creating a game using Java and I look forward to trying more in the future.

### Installation

1. Download VS Code on your computer, whichever version is most recent.
2. Download JDK 23 from this website https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/ in order to run the project locally.
3. Now clone this project using this link https://github.com/Jona543/SpaceInvaders.git onto your own computer.
4. Once it has downloaded, open in VS Code using the command: "code .". 
5. Navigate to the file "App.java" within the project and use the "Run Java" button in the top right hand side of that file. This will open the game in a new window.
6. Use the right and left arrows on you keyboard to move left and right, and press space to shoot bullets at the moving aliens.
7. When the game has finished, press any key to reset the game and play again!
